# List of IPs to Ignore on startup
# Each IP in this list is set to Ignore in GBUdb when
# The configuration is loaded.
# Hash mark on the beginning of a line indicates a comment.
# Comments after an IP are also ignored.
# One line per IP. Sorry, no CIDR yet.
# Be sure to list ALL of your gateways :-)
